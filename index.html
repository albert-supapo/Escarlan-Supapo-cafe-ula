      <p><b>"Drinking coffee is not my habit, it's my hobby".</b>
      </p>
      <p>Why would you want coffee as a hobby? It's fun, delicious, social, and you can spend as little as $5 or as much as your car, and you can just keep getting awesome things.</p>
      
      <p><b>"My hobby is eating different kinds of ramen and comparing them, and my future dream is to be the greatest Hokage!"</b></p>
      <p>
        Ramen makes you full and satisfied.

        A lot of people get stuffed and satisfied. Because wheat flour is used for ramen noodles, so it is easy for you to feel full. Drinking the soup from your ramen also makes you satisfied and comforted too!

      <p>The beans you brew are actually the processed and roasted seeds from a fruit, which is called a coffee cherry. The coffee cherry's outer skin is called the exocarp. Beneath it is the mesocarp, a thin layer of pulp, followed by a slimy layer called the parenchyma.</p>
